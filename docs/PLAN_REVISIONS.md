# Plan documents and revisions

A plan the user cannot edit is a report, not a plan. `workspace.planning`
exports an implementation plan to a workspace file, reads the user's edits back
out of it, and binds later work to the revision they actually approved.

## The round trip

`export` writes the plan and records the revision it hashes to.

- `format: "json"` writes the plan itself, so the file is the plan.
- `format: "markdown"` writes the rendered prose **plus** a trailing
  `<!-- clawai-plan-revision sha256:… { … } -->` block.

The comment block exists because the prose is lossy. Markdown prints headings,
evidence and acceptance criteria for a human; it does not print every field the
schema requires, so a plan re-derived from headings alone would silently drop
what the renderer never printed. The block is the plan of record; the prose is
the part meant to be read.

`adopt` takes the document back — `{ "document": "<file contents>" }` — parses
whichever format it is in, validates it against the plan schema, and returns
`{ plan, revision, change }`.

- Editing the **prose** around the block changes nothing: `change` is
  `unchanged`. There is no way to tell prose that restates the plan from prose
  written about it, so restating is not an edit.
- Editing the **block** is an edit and is honoured: `change` is `revised`.
- A document that carries no plan, or a block edited into something the schema
  rejects, is refused rather than guessed at.

## What the revision binds

The revision is `sha256` over the plan with object keys sorted, so it tracks
plan content and not the order a plan happened to be built in. It is computed
from the plan, never from the document that carries it — reformatting Markdown
must not invent a revision the user never made.

Any planning operation may name the revision it read:

```json
{ "operation": "issue-payloads", "revision": "sha256:…", "plan": { … } }
```

- Naming **no** revision is allowed. A caller that never learned about
  revisions is not asserting anything about which plan it read.
- Naming the **bound** revision proceeds.
- Naming any **other** revision is refused with `Plan revision is stale`. That
  assertion is false, and acting on it would execute a plan the user has
  already replaced.

Adopting a plan is still not permission to run it. Every response carries
`executionPermissionGranted: false`, and global and project policy remain
authoritative regardless of what a plan document says.

## Where it lives

| Concern                                 | File                                           |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Hashing, embedding, parsing, staleness  | `src/core/plan-revision.ts`                    |
| Plan schema and Markdown renderer       | `src/core/implementation-plan.ts`              |
| Operation wiring and the bound revision | `src/infrastructure/planning-tool-executor.ts` |

## Resuming

A run records the mode it started in and the plan revision it last asserted it
was working against. Both live on the durable run journal, because that is what
survives a window reload; the chat session registry does not.

**The prompt carries the mode, and the journal's goal does not.** Plan mode is
applied where the run starts, so the journal keeps the raw request. A goal that
already carried the read-only instruction would collect a second copy of it on
every resume.

**Restoring the mode is tighten-only in both directions.** A run that was
planning does not start writing because the workspace setting moved while it
was parked, and a workspace since switched to Plan is not overridden by an
older Auto run. `PLAN` anywhere wins. A journal written before runs recorded
their mode contributes nothing, and the current setting decides alone. Because
restoring can only narrow, it never needs an approval of its own.

**The revision is read off the call, not the result.** `export` is hashed from
the plan it is writing, `adopt` from the document it is handing back, and every
other operation from the `revision` it names. A run interrupted mid-export
still recorded which plan it was exporting. Anything malformed records nothing
rather than throwing: journalling a call must not be what rejects it.

Plan mode itself is enforced by policy, not by the prompt —
`src/core/policy-v2.ts` denies every non-read effect in `PLAN` as an immutable
rail. The instruction exists so the model plans rather than discovering the
mode by having each edit refused in turn.
