`src/extension.ts` is the composition root. It registers all contributed
commands and views and owns disposable lifetimes.

## Layers

- `src/core`: pure URL, session schema, state, model catalog, context,
  redaction, SSE, and edit-plan logic.
- `src/backend`: runtime contracts and the single authenticated HTTP client.
- `src/services`: chat, workflow, model, project/global context, configuration,
  initialization, and edit orchestration.
- `src/infrastructure`: VS Code output and atomic workspace-edit adapters.
- `src/views` and `src/webview`: editor presentation only.

Services use structural ports where meaningful, allowing security-critical
logic to run under Node without a VS Code host.

## Data flow

Login creates a `VSCODE` session, stages its token pair, validates the profile
with the staged access token, and then stores tokens in origin-scoped
`SecretStorage`. A candidate backend is not activated until authorization and
profile validation succeed. Authenticated requests attach the access token. A
single shared refresh promise prevents concurrent refresh storms; credential
and account epochs reject late writes after logout or endpoint replacement.

Chat creates or reuses a thread, opens the SSE stream before sending the
message, attributes provider/model events, assembles bounded output, and falls
back to persisted assistant messages if the stream ends without content.

Workspace collection filters paths before reading files, enforces byte/file
budgets, and records a receipt. Project workflows prepend profile-wide rules
and then `.clawai` rules, architecture, and memory.

Edit workflows parse one strict JSON edit plan. A VS Code adapter reads
before-state, opens diffs, captures an in-session backup, and applies a single
`WorkspaceEdit`.

## Ownership boundaries

The backend owns users, sessions, threads, messages, model availability,
entitlements, quotas, routing, provider credentials, and inference. The
extension never imports parent-monorepo code and never connects to service
databases or RabbitMQ.
