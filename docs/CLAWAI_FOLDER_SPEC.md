# `.clawai` project folder specification

`.clawai` is optional, project-owned, and safe to commit when it contains no
secrets. **ClawAI: Initialize .clawai** creates missing files only.
`policies/policy.json` and `agents/agents.json` get editor validation and
autocomplete from the schemas the extension registers in
`contributes.jsonValidation`.

- `rules.md`: non-negotiable repository rules.
- `architecture.md`: boundaries and dependency direction.
- `memory.md`: durable, non-secret lessons.
- `context/*`: product, API, data, and gate facts.
- `skills/*`: stack-specific implementation guidance, and slash commands. A
  file named `review.md` is invocable as `/review`; see below.
- `prompts/*`: reusable review and planning instructions.
- `ignore`: one glob per line; blank lines and `#` comments are ignored.
- `policies/policy.json`: the project permission policy. See below.
- `agents/agents.json`: named sub-agent presets. See below.

A subdirectory may carry its own `.clawai/rules.md`, `architecture.md` and
`memory.md`. Every directory from the workspace root down to the open file is
searched, root first and nearest last, so guidance closer to the code speaks
after the repository-wide guidance it narrows.

## `skills/*.md` as slash commands

Every `.md` file in `skills/` is a command. `review.md` is `/review`, typed at
the start of a message. A `skills` directory in this VS Code profile’s global
storage works the same way, and a project skill of the same name wins — a
repository that ships a `review` skill means its own review.

An optional header names it something other than the filename:

```markdown
---
name: code-review
description: Review a diff for correctness and security
argument-hint: <path>
---

Review for correctness, security and missing tests.
```

The header is read with a three-field parser, not a YAML library: this is
workspace content, and a full parser is a large attack surface for three
fields. Anything it does not understand stays in the body rather than being
guessed at, so a malformed header costs the header and not the skill.

`takes everything typed after the command;`…`` take one
whitespace-separated argument each. A placeholder nobody filled becomes empty
rather than staying literal. A body with no placeholder at all gets the
arguments appended, because a command that silently discarded what the user
typed would look broken exactly when they bothered to type something.

An unknown command is sent as ordinary text rather than refused: a message
starting with a slash must stay sendable, and the user may have meant the
words.

## `output-styles/*.md`

The same shape as `skills/`, one directory over. Each file names a response
style; `house.md` becomes a style called `house`, selectable with **ClawAI:
Select Output Style**, and a file with a `name:` header can call itself
something else. A project style replaces a built-in of the same name, so a
repository can redefine what `concise` means here.

The body is prepended to the prompt as an instruction to the model, so it is
written in the language the prompts are written in — the built-in styles stay
English for that reason, and only their labels in the picker are translated.

## `policies/policy.json`

Every field narrows what the agent may do; none widens it.

```json
{
  "deniedEffects": ["publication"],
  "maximumRisk": "R2",
  "requireApproval": ["local-mutation"],
  "rules": [
    { "pathGlob": "infra/*", "outcome": "ask", "reason": "infra changes are reviewed" },
    { "commandGlob": "git push*", "outcome": "deny", "reason": "pushes are manual here" },
    { "tool": "workspace.database", "outcome": "deny", "reason": "no database access" }
  ]
}
```

A rule matches on any of `tool`, `operation`, `pathGlob` and `commandGlob`, and
must name at least one — a rule that matches nothing in particular matches
everything, which is never what the author meant. `pathGlob` is tested against
the paths a call actually names, and `commandGlob` against the executable and
its arguments joined. Patterns are `*` globs, not regular expressions.

Two properties are deliberate and worth relying on:

- **`outcome` is `ask` or `deny`, never `allow`.** This file lives inside the
  workspace, and workspace content is untrusted. A repository that could write
  `allow` would be a repository that grants itself permissions by being cloned.
  Tightening is safe from an untrusted source because the worst a hostile rule
  achieves is refusing to do something.
- **Order does not matter.** When rules disagree, a `deny` wins over an `ask`,
  so a hand-written file can be read without simulating the list.

Rules are consulted after the immutable safety rails, so no rule can loosen a
workspace-trust denial or the elevation, production and destructive rails.
Patterns are globs rather than regular expressions for the same reason: an
expression from an untrusted file is a denial-of-service waiting for the right
input.

Workspace collection treats all of these files as normal bounded context.
Project workflows explicitly prepend rules, architecture, and memory.

## `agents/agents.json`

Named presets a sub-agent graph can reference by name instead of restating an
identity on every fork. Each entry adds instructions; none of them can widen
what a forked task is already allowed to do.

```json
[
  {
    "name": "strict-reviewer",
    "description": "Reviews for correctness and security with no tolerance for scope creep.",
    "systemPrompt": "You are a strict reviewer. Flag every unverified claim and reject scope creep."
  }
]
```

A sub-agent task still declares its own `tools`, `modelPolicy`, `budget`, and
`riskCeiling` on every fork — those never come from a definition. Naming a
`definitionName` only prepends the matching preset's `systemPrompt` and
`description` to that task's prompt; an unresolved name is silently ignored,
never guessed at. `name` must be lowercase, start with a letter, and contain
only letters, digits, and hyphens; names must be unique within the file.

This file is workspace content, trusted the same way `rules.md`,
`architecture.md`, and `memory.md` already are — a definition's `systemPrompt`
is instructions, not a grant, so it carries no more authority than any other
project guidance a sub-agent already reads.

The extension always excludes `.git`, dependency/output directories, `.env`,
and secret/credential/API-key-like paths. `.clawai/ignore` can only add
exclusions.

Profile-wide `global-rules.md` and `global-skills.md` are opened with their
ClawAI commands and stored in VS Code extension global storage. They apply
before project rules and are not copied into repositories.
